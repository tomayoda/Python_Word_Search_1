# Python_Word_Search_1

I have been doing a self-teach of Python 3.11.
My age is beyond senior, I am an elder.
I applied all of my basic level Python to creating
  this word search application.  Only simple Python
  code was used. 
I taught BASIC programming many many years ago.

Most of the print statements are #. 
Use Cntl+/ to turn print statements on to see the
extreme detail of what the source code does.

There are many features that I included to 
show what I have learned about Python, so far.

The program reads a 15x15 letter matrix and
24,30 or 40 word list.  It searches
Horizontal Vertical and Diagonal both ways.

I included a 560 word list (3 char words) to
search for all 3 letter words in any 15x15.
My present code is limited to 40 words so 
I broke up the 560 words into 40 word groups.
I only created 5 sets. 

I included example EXCEL spreadsheet to open 
and retrieve 15x15 matrix and words. Then
write out the text file as source data.

I have tested with many sets of source data.

If you are learning Python, this is a master
class of elemental Python coding.  

Maybe someone has coded this game with more
sophisticated skill.  Beginners need simplicity.
Thanks, 
Toma
